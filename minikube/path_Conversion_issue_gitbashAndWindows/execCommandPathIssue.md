# Resolving Path Conversion Issues with Git Bash and kubectl

## Problem

When using Git Bash on Windows to execute Kubernetes commands via kubectl, path conversion by Git Bash can lead to errors. Specifically, commands targeting containers may fail due to Git Bash incorrectly translating Unix-like paths (e.g., /bin/bash) into Windows-style paths (e.g., C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/bash).

### Error Command
~~~
kubectl exec -it python-web-application-78ff7cccd8-74wb2 -- /bin/bash
~~~

Error Output
~~~

OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/bash": stat C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/bash: no such file or directory: unknown
command terminated with exit code 126
~~~

This error occurs because Git Bash converts /bin/bash into C:/Program Files/Git/usr/bin/bash, which does not exist in the Linux container.

Solution

The solution is to disable Git Bash’s automatic path conversion by setting the MSYS_NO_PATHCONV environment variable. This ensures that the Unix-like path (/bin/bash) is sent to Kubernetes without being modified.

Steps to Fix the Issue

Temporarily Disable Path Conversion

Run the following command to disable path conversion for the current session:
~~~

export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
~~~

Retry the problematic command:
~~~

kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/bash
~~~

Expected Output: The command should execute successfully, and you should enter the container’s Bash shell.

Make the Fix Permanent
To avoid setting MSYS_NO_PATHCONV every time, add it to your Git Bash profile:

Open the .bashrc file in your home directory:
~~~

nano ~/.bashrc
~~~

Add the following line:
~~~

export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
~~~

Save and reload the profile:
~~~

source ~/.bashrc
~~~
This change will apply the fix to all future Git Bash sessions.

## Why This Works

Disabling path conversion prevents Git Bash from translating Unix-like paths into Windows-style paths. As a result, the command is sent exactly as written, allowing Kubernetes to correctly interpret and execute it within the Linux container.

## Additional Notes

If you use other terminals like PowerShell or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), this issue won’t occur because they don’t perform path translation.

For debugging, you can verify how Git Bash processes paths by echoing the command:
~~~

echo kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
~~~

By following these steps, you can ensure smooth execution of Kubernetes commands using Git Bash on Windows.
